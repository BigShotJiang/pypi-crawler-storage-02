And it is inspired\n        by the [WebView toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-webview-ui-toolkit)\n        as example for creating a customized toolkit.\n        \n        ## Release\n        \n        The UI Toolkit is currently in a proof of concept. Track progress towards 1.0 [here](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyter-ui-toolkit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av1.0).\n        Styles and API are not guarantee between minor versions prior to v1.0.0.\n        \n        ## Getting started\n        \n        You will need to install `yarn` (for example with `npm install --global yarn`).\n        \n        To build the components packages, execute:\n        \n        ```sh\n        yarn install\n        yarn build\n        ```\n        \n        Then to interactively test or develop web components:\n        \n        ```sh\n        cd packages/components\n        yarn start\n        ```\n        \n        ### JupyterLab demo extension\n        \n        To test locally the JupyterLab demo extension, using `conda` package manager:\n        \n        ```sh\n        conda create -n jupyter-toolkit -c conda-forge -y nodejs yarn jupyterlab=3\n        conda activate jupyter-toolkit\n        yarn install\n        yarn build\n        pip install -e .\n        jupyter labextension develop --overwrite .\n        ```\n        \n        ## Documentation\n        \n        Further documentation can be found in the following places:\n        \n        - [Component Docs](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyter-ui-toolkit/tree/main/packages/components/docs/components.md)\n        - [Storybook (Interactive Component Sandbox)](https://jupyterlab-contrib.github.io/jupyter-ui-toolkit/)\n        - [Toolkit Extension Samples](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyter-ui-toolkit/tree/main/packages/lab-example):\n          [Try online](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyter-ui-toolkit/main)\n        \n        ## Contributing\n        \n        See the [contributing](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyter-ui-toolkit/tree/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) documentation.\n        \n        -----------\n        \n        The following npm package may be included in this product:\n        \n         - @jupyter/ydoc@3.0.2\n        \n        This package contains the following license and notice below:\n        \n        # @jupyter/ydoc\n        \n        `@jupyter/ydoc` provides [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs)-based data structures for various\n        documents used in the Jupyter ecosystem.

Since kernel messages\n        include the client id, it is easy for a client to filter kernel messages for\n        just messages between it and the kernel. In JupyterLab, different activities\n        (such as a console and a notebook) are usually considered separate clients when\n        connected to the same kernel.\n        \n        ### Kernel specs\n        \n        A _kernel spec_ is the data about an available kernel on the system. We can\n        retrieve a current list of kernel specs from the server.\n        \n        ### Kernels\n        \n        A _kernel_ represents a running process on the server that implements the\n        Jupyter kernel messaging protocol.\n        \n        #### Kernel model\n        \n        A _kernel model_ mirrors the server kernel models, and represents a single\n        running kernel on the server. A kernel can be created, restarted, shut down,\n        etc., through calls to the server. A kernel model's lifecycle mirrors the\n        server kernel model's lifecycle, and it will be disposed when the server\n        kernel is shut down.\n        \n        #### Kernel connection\n        \n        A _kernel connection_ represents a single client connecting to a kernel over a\n        websocket. Typically only one kernel connection handles comms for any given\n        kernel. The kernel connection is disposed when the client no longer has a need\n        for the connection. Disposing a kernel connection does not cause the kernel to\n        shut down. However, if a kernel is shut down, (eventually) all of its kernel\n        connections should be disposed if they were initiated from a kernel manager.\n        If the kernel connections were instantiated outside of a manager, you are\n        responsible for cleaning them up.\n        \n        A kernel connection has a number of signals, such as kernel status, kernel\n        connection status, etc.\n        \n        #### Kernel manager\n        \n        A _kernel manager_ is an object that maintains a list of kernel models by\n        regular polling. The kernel manager can instantiate a kernel connection and\n        will manage its lifecycle (e.g., when the kernel is shut down, the connections\n        will be disposed). The manager provides some minimal bookkeeping around\n        kernels and their connections. Generally, it is easiest to interact with\n        kernels on a server through a manager.\n        \n        ### Sessions\n        \n        A _session_ is a mapping on the server from an identifying string (the\n        session's `path`) to a kernel. A session has a few other pieces of information\n        to allow for easy categorization and searching of sessions.\n        \n        The primary usecase of a session is to enable persisting a connection to a\n        kernel. For example, a notebook viewer may start a session with session path\n        of the notebook's file path. When a browser is refreshed, the notebook viewer\n        can connect to the same kernel by asking the server for the session\n        corresponding with the notebook file path.\n        \n        #### Session model\n        \n        A _session model_ mirrors a server session. The session models can be\n        refreshed from the server, created, changed (including creating a new session\n        kernel), and shut down (which implies that the kernel will be shut down). A\n        session model's lifecycle mirrors the server session's lifecycle, and it will\n        be disposed when the server session is shut down.\n        \n        #### Session connection\n        \n        A _session connection_ represents a single client connected to a session's\n        kernel. A session's kernel connection can change and may be null to signify no\n        current kernel connection. A session connection owns the kernel connection,\n        meaning the kernel connection is created and disposed by the session\n        connection as needed. The session connection proxies signals from the kernel\n        connection for convenience (e.g., you can listen to the session's status\n        signal to get status changes for whatever the current kernel is, without\n        having to disconnect and reconnect your signal handlers every time the session\n        kernel changes). The session connection can be disposed when the client no\n        longer is connected to that session's kernel, and disposal will not cause the\n        session model to be deleted.\n        \n        #### Session manager\n        \n        A _session manager_ is an object that maintains a list of session models by\n        regular polling. The session manager can instantiate a session connection and\n        will manage its lifecycle (e.g., when the session is shut down, the connections\n        will be disposed). The manager provides some minimal bookkeeping around\n        sessions and their connections. Generally, it is easiest to interact with\n        sessions on a server through a manager.\n        \n        ### Session Context\n        \n        A _session context_ is an object which has the same lifecycle as the client.\n        The session context owns a session connection (which may be null if the client\n        is not currently associated with a session). The session context proxies the\n        current session connection's signals for convenience. The session context\n        primarily serves as a stable object for a client to keep track of the current\n        session connection. The session context also contains some convenience\n        functionality, such as preferences for whether a kernel should be started and\n        a user-friendly kernel name and status.\n        \n        Here is a diagram that provides an overview of the different components:\n        \n        ![architecture-diagram](./architecture.png)\n        \n        _The diagram can be edited on [diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net) by importing the [source](./architecture.xml)_.\n        \n        -----------\n        \n        The following npm package may be included in this product:\n        \n         - @jupyterlab/translation@4.3.4\n        \n        This package contains the following license and notice below:\n        \n        # @jupyterlab/translation\n        \n        Translation utilities.\n        \n        -----------\n        \n        The following npm package may be included in this product:\n        \n         - @jupyterlab/ui-components@4.3.4\n        \n        This package contains the following license and notice below:\n        \n        <!--\n        THIS FILE IS AUTOGENERATED, DO NOT EDIT\n        \n        Instead, make changes to docs sources in `packages/ui-components/docs`,\n        then run \"jlpm docs:init\" to refresh the built docs\n        -->\n        \n        # @jupyterlab/ui-components\n        \n        The\n        [@jupyterlab/ui-components](https://jupyterlab.github.io/jupyterlab/modules/_ui_components_src_index_.html)\n        package provides UI elements that are widely used in JupyterLab core,\n        and that can be reused in your own extensions.\n        \n        For example, all of the icons in JupyterLab core can be reused via\n        `LabIcon`. You can also use `LabIcon` to create your own custom icons\n        that will be able to automatically change color to match the current\n        JupyterLab theme.\n        \n        # `LabIcon` - set up and render icons\n        \n        `LabIcon` is the icon class used by JupyterLab, and is part of the new\n        icon system introduced in JupyterLab v2.0.\n        \n        ## How JupyterLab handles icons\n        \n        The @jupyterlab/ui-components package provides icons to the rest of\n        JupyterLab, in the form of a set of `LabIcon` instances (currently about\n        80). All of the icons in the core JupyterLab packages are rendered using\n        one of these `LabIcon` instances.\n        \n        ## Using the icons in your own code\n        \n        You can use any of JupyterLab icons in your own code via an `import`\n        statement. For example, to use `jupyterIcon` you would first do:\n        \n        ```typescript\n        import { jupyterIcon } from '@jupyterlab/ui-components';\n        ```\n        \n        ## How to render an icon into a DOM node\n        \n        Icons can be added as children to any `div` or `span` nodes using the\n        `icon.element(...)` method (where `icon` is any instance of `LabIcon`).\n        For example, to render the Jupyter icon you could do:\n        \n        ```typescript\n        jupyterIcon.element({\n          container: elem,\n          height: '16px',\n          width: '16px',\n          marginLeft: '2px'\n        });\n        ```\n        \n        where `elem` is any `HTMLElement` with a `div` or `span` tag. As shown\n        in the above example, the icon can be styled by passing CSS parameters\n        into `.element(...)`. Any valid CSS parameter can be used (one catch:\n        snake case params do have to be converted to camel case: instead of\n        `foo-bar: '8px'`, you’d need to use `fooBar: '8px'`.\n        \n        ## How to render an icon as a React component\n        \n        Icons can also be rendered using React. The `icon.react` parameter holds\n        a standard React component that will display the icon on render. Like\n        any React component, `icon.react` can be used in various ways.\n        \n        For example, here is how you would add the Jupyter icon to the render\n        tree of another React component:\n        \n        ```jsx\n        public render() {\n          return (\n            <div className=\"outer\">\n              <div className=\"inner\">\n                <jupyterIcon.react tag=\"span\" right=\"7px\" top=\"5px\" />\n                \"and here's a text node\"\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          );\n        }\n        ```\n        \n        Alternatively, you can just render the icon directly into any existing\n        DOM node `elem` by using the `ReactDOM` module:\n        \n        ```typescript\n        const root = createRoot(elem);\n        root.render(jupyterIcon.react);\n        ```\n        \n        If do you use `ReactDOM` to render, and if the `elem` node is ever\n        removed from the DOM, you’ll first need to clean it up:\n        \n        ```typescript\n        root.unmount();\n        ```\n        \n        This cleanup step is not a special property of `LabIcon`, but is instead\n        needed for any React component that is rendered directly at the top\n        level by `ReactDOM`.\n        \n        ## How to create your own custom `LabIcon`\n        \n        You can create your own custom icon by constructing a new instance of\n        `LabIcon`:\n        \n        ```typescript\n        export const fooIcon = new LabIcon({\n          name: 'barpkg:foo',\n          svgstr: '<svg>...</svg>'\n        });\n        ```\n        \n        where `name` should be of the form “your-pkg:icon-name”, and `svgstr` is\n        the raw contents of your icon’s svg file.\n        \n        ## How to create a new `LabIcon` from an external svg file\n        \n        Although you can copy-and-paste an svg directly into the `LabIcon`\n        constructor, the best practice is to keep the svg for each of your icons\n        in its own separate svg file. You will need to have an `svg.d.ts` file\n        at the root of your project’s `src` directory:\n        \n        ```typescript\n        // svg.d.ts\n        \n        declare module '*.svg' {\n          const value: string;\n          export default value;\n        }\n        ```\n        \n        You can then `import` the contents of an svg file:\n        \n        ```typescript\n        import fooSvgstr from 'path-to-your/foo.svg';\n        \n        export const fooIcon = new LabIcon({\n          name: 'barpkg:foo',\n          svgstr: fooSvgstr\n        });\n        ```\n        \n        ##

You can\n        achieve this using one of the `jp-iconX` classes.\n        \n        **Example: check icon**\n        \n        _svg source:_\n        \n        ```html\n        <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"100\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n          <path\n            class=\"jp-icon3\"\n            fill=\"#616161\"\n            d=\"M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z\"\n          />\n        </svg>\n        ```\n        \n        _rendered icon:_\n        \n        <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"100\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n          <path class=\"jp-icon3\" fill=\"#616161\" d=\"M9 16.17L4.83 12l-1.42 1.41L9 19 21 7l-1.41-1.41z\"/>\n        </svg>\n        \n        ### Adding classes to a multi-colored icon\n        \n        For more complex icons, each element that needs to match the background\n        should be annotated with a `jp-icon-accentX` class, while each element\n        that needs to contrast with the background should be annotated with a\n        `jp-iconX` class.\n        \n        **Example: close-circle icon**\n        \n        _svg source:_\n        \n        ```html\n        <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"100\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n          <circle class=\"jp-icon3\" fill=\"#616161\" cx=\"12\" cy=\"12\" r=\"11\" />\n          <rect\n            class=\"jp-icon-accent0\"\n            fill=\"#fff\"\n            height=\"18\"\n            width=\"2\"\n            x=\"11\"\n            y=\"3\"\n            transform=\"rotate(315, 12, 12)\"\n          />\n          <rect\n            class=\"jp-icon-accent0\"\n            fill=\"#fff\"\n            height=\"18\"\n            width=\"2\"\n            x=\"11\"\n            y=\"3\"\n            transform=\"rotate(45, 12, 12)\"\n          />\n        </svg>\n        ```\n        \n        _rendered icon:_\n        \n        <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"100\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n          <circle class=\"jp-icon3\" fill=\"#616161\" cx=\"12\" cy=\"12\" r=\"11\"/>\n          <rect class=\"jp-icon-accent0\" fill=\"#fff\" height=\"18\" width=\"2\" x=\"11\" y=\"3\" transform=\"rotate(315, 12, 12)\"/>\n          <rect class=\"jp-icon-accent0\" fill=\"#fff\" height=\"18\" width=\"2\" x=\"11\" y=\"3\" transform=\"rotate(45, 12, 12)\"/>\n        </svg>\n        \n        ## Background\n        \n        ### Icon handling in Jupyterlab\n        \n        Pre JupyterLab 2.0, most icons were created using the\n        icons-as-css-background pattern:\n        \n        - Set up the icon’s svg as a `background-image` in CSS:\n        \n          ```css\n          /* CSS */\n        \n          .jp-FooIcon {\n            background-image: url('path-to-your/foo.svg');\n          }\n          ```\n        \n        - Add the icon to the DOM by constructing an otherwise empty DOM node\n          with the appropriate class:\n        \n          ```typescript\n          // typescript\n        \n          const e = document.createElement('div');\n          e.className = 'jp-FooIcon';\n          document.body.append(e);\n          ```\n        \n        What you end up with is a single DOM node that has the “foo” icon as a\n        background image.\n        \n        Post JupyterLab 2.0, nearly all icons in core are now created using\n        [LabIcon](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/blob/f0153e0258b32674c9aec106383ddf7b618cebab/packages/ui-components/src/icon/labicon.tsx)\n        and the icons-as-inline-svg pattern:\n        \n        - Construct a new instance of LabIcon from the icon’s name and svg:\n        \n          ```typescript\n          // typescript\n        \n          // svgstr is the raw contents of an icon's svg file\n          export const fooIcon = new LabIcon({\n            name: 'barpkg:foo',\n            svgstr: '<svg>...</svg>'\n          });\n          ```\n        \n        - Add the icon to the DOM using the appropriate property of your\n          LabIcon instance (either LabIcon.element() to directly create a DOM\n          node, or LabIcon.react to get the icon as a react component):\n        \n          ```typescript\n          // typescript\n        \n          const e = fooIcon.element();\n          document.body.append(e);\n          ```\n        \n        What you end up with is a DOM node (by default a ‘div’) that has an\n        inline svg node as a child.\n        \n        ### `background-image` vs inline svg\n        \n        The big limitation of the old icon-as-css-background pattern is that svg\n        images rendered as `background-image` are invisible to CSS. On the other\n        hand, an icon rendered as an inline svg node is fully exposed to the\n        CSS. This allows us to dynamically change icon styling as needed simply by\n        modifying our CSS.

It\n        also provides rate limiters (`Debouncer` and `Throttler`).\n        \n        The `Poll` class provides three different ways to \"subscribe\" to poll ticks:\n        \n        - [`@lumino/signaling`](../signaling/): `Poll#ticked` is a Lumino signal that\n          emits each time there is a poll tick.\n        - `Promise`-based: `Poll#tick` is a promise that resolves after every tick and\n          only rejects when the poll is disposed.\n        - `AsyncIterable`: `Poll#[`Symbol.asyncIterator`]` implements the async iterable\n          protocol that allows iteration using [`for-await...of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of) loops.\n        \n        ## Example usage\n        \n        These are examples from the unit tests for this package. They\n        demonstrate the three different ways polling is supported.\n        \n        ### Using `Poll#tick` promise\n        \n        Here, we set up the testing state variables and create a new `Poll` instance.\n        \n        ```typescript\n        const expected = 'started resolved resolved';\n        const ticker: IPoll.Phase<any>[] = [];\n        const tock = (poll: Poll) => {\n          ticker.push(poll.state.phase);\n          poll.tick.then(tock).catch(() => undefined);\n        };\n        const poll = new Poll({\n          auto: false,\n          factory: () => Promise.resolve(),\n          frequency: { interval: 100, backoff: false }\n        });\n        ```\n        \n        Next we assign the `tock` function to run after the poll ticks and\n        we start the poll.\n        \n        ```typescript\n        void poll.tick.then(tock);\n        void poll.start();\n        ```\n        \n        And we verify that the `ticker` did indeed get populated when `tock`\n        was called and the next promise was captured as well.\n        \n        ```typescript\n        await sleep(1000); // Sleep for longer than the interval.\n        expect(ticker.join(' ').startsWith(expected)).to.equal(true);\n        poll.dispose();\n        ```\n        \n        ### Using `Poll#ticked` signal\n        \n        Here, we set up the testing state variables and create a new `Poll` instance.\n        \n        ```typescript\n        const poll = new Poll<void, void>({\n          factory: () => Promise.resolve(),\n          frequency: { interval: 100, backoff: false }\n        });\n        ```\n        \n        Here we connect to the `ticked` signal and simply check that each\n        tick matches the poll `state` accessor's contents.\n        \n        ```typescript\n        poll.ticked.connect((_, tick) => {\n          expect(tick).to.equal(poll.state);\n        });\n        await sleep(1000); // Sleep for longer than the interval.\n        poll.dispose();\n        ```\n        \n        ### Using `Poll` as an `AsyncIterable`\n        \n        Here, we set up the testing state variables and create a new `Poll` instance.\n        \n        ```typescript\n        let poll: Poll;\n        let total = 2;\n        let i = 0;\n        \n        poll = new Poll({\n          auto: false,\n          factory: () => Promise.resolve(++i > total ? poll.dispose() : void 0),\n          frequency: { interval: Poll.IMMEDIATE }\n        });\n        \n        const expected = `started${' resolved'.repeat(total)}`;\n        const ticker: IPoll.Phase<any>[] = [];\n        ```\n        \n        Then the poll is started:\n        \n        ```typescript\n        void poll.start();\n        ```\n        \n        Instead of connecting to the `ticked` signal or awaiting the `tick` promise, we can now use a `for-await...of` loop:\n        \n        ```typescript\n        for await (const state of poll) {\n          ticker.push(state.phase);\n          if (poll.isDisposed) {\n            break;\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n        \n        And we check to make sure the results are as expected:\n        \n        ```typescript\n        // ticker and expected both equal:\n        // 'started resolved resolved disposed'\n        expect(ticker.join(' ')).to.equal(expected);\n        ```\n        \n        ### Note for consumers of async iterators\n        \n        In order to use `for-await...of` loops in TypeScript, you will need to use `ES2018` or above in your `lib` array in `tsconfig.json`.\n        \n        -----------\n        \n        The following npm package may be included in this product:\n        \n         - @marijn/find-cluster-break@1.0.2\n        \n        This package contains the following license and notice below:\n        \n        MIT License\n        \n        Copyright (C) 2024 by Marijn Haverbeke <marijn@haverbeke.berlin>\n        \n        Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n        of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n        in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n        to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n        copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n        furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n        \n        The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n        all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n        \n        THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n        IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n        FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Use the individual string `key` values instead.\n        \n        ### Localization utilities\n        \n        #### Typescript enum\n        \n        The `Direction` enum contains the `ltr` and `rtl` enum for use in a Typescript project.\n        \n        ```typescript\n        import { Direction } from \"@microsoft/fast-web-utilities\";\n        \n        let direction: Direction = Direction.ltr;\n        ```\n        \n        ### Number utilities\n        \n        #### Limit\n        \n        The `limit` function ensures that a value is between a min and max value. If the value is lower than min, min will be returned. If the value is greater than max, max will be retured.\n        \n        ```js\n        import { limit } from \"@microsoft/fast-web-utilities\";\n        const incomingNumber; // 11 \n        const setNumberByLimit = limit(0, 10, incomingNumber); // returns 10\n        ```\n        \n        #### wrapInBounds\n        \n        The `wrapInBounds` function keeps a given value within the bounds of a min and max value. If the value is larger than the max, the minimum value will be returned. If the value is smaller than the minimum, the maximum will be returned. Otherwise, the value is returned un-changed.\n        \n        ```js\n        import { wrapInBounds } from \"@microsoft/fast-web-utilities\";\n        const slides; // 5\n        const index; // 5\n        const activeIndex = wrapInBounds(0, this.slides.length - 1, index) // returns 0\n        ```\n        \n        ### String utilities\n        \n        #### Format\n        \n        The `format` function builds a string from a format specifier and replacement parameters.\n        \n        ```js\n        import { format } from \"@microsoft/fast-web-utilities\";\n        \n        const formatterString = \"View {0} {1}\";\n        \n        const newString = format(formatterString, \"page\", \"4\")); // \"View page 4\"\n        ```\n        \n        #### startsWith\n        \n        The `startsWith` function checks to see if one string starts with another. The function is case sensitive.\n        \n        ```js\n        import { startsWith } from \"@microsoft/fast-web-utilities\";\n        \n        const matchIsFalse = startsWith(\"HelloWorld\", \"World\"); // false\n        const matchIsTrue = startsWith(\"HelloWorld\", \"Hello\"); // true\n        ```\n        \n        #### isNullOrWhiteSpace\n        \n        The `isNullOrWhiteSpace` function determines if the specified string is undefined, null, empty, or whitespace. The function returns true if the value is undefined, null, empty, or whitespace, otherwise false.\n        \n        ```js\n        import { isNullOrWhiteSpace } from \"@microsoft/fast-web-utilities\";\n        \n        const myAnchor = document.querySelector(\"#id\");\n        const checkWhitespace = isNullOrWhiteSpace(myAnchor.href);\n        ```\n        \n        #### pascalCase\n        \n        The `pascalCase` function converts a string to Pascal Case\n        \n        ```js\n        import { pascalCase } from \"@microsoft/fast-web-utilities\";\n        \n        const hyphenatedToPascal = pascalCase(\"my-string\");\n        const uppercaseToPascal = pascalCase(\"MY STRING\");\n        const whitespaceToPascal = pascalCase(\" my string \");\n        ```\n        \n        #### classNames\n        A utility for merging class names into a single string conditionally. Accepts any number of strings, functions that return strings and two index arrays where the first index is a string or function that returns a string, and the second index is a boolean.\n        \n        ```js\n        import { classNames } from \"@microsoft/fast-web-utilities\";\n        \n        // evaluates to \"classOne classTwo classThree classFive\"\n        const myJoinedClassNames = classNames(\n            \"classOne\",\n            () => \"classTwo\",\n            [\"classThree\", true],\n            [\"classFour\", false]\n            [() => \"classFive\", true],\n            [() => \"classSix\", false]\n        )\n        ```\n        \n        -----------\n        \n        The following npm packages may be included in this product:\n        \n         - @mui/base@5.0.0-dev.20240529-082515-213b5e33ab\n         - @mui/core-downloads-tracker@5.16.14\n         - @mui/icons-material@5.16.14\n         - @mui/material@5.16.14\n         - @mui/private-theming@5.16.14\n         - @mui/styled-engine@5.16.14\n         - @mui/system@5.16.14\n         - @mui/types@7.2.21\n         - @mui/utils@5.16.14\n         - @mui/utils@6.4.1\n        \n        These packages each contain the following license and notice below:\n        \n        The MIT License (MIT)\n        \n        Copyright (c) 2014 Call-Em-All\n        \n        Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n        of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n        in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n        to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n        copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n        furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n        \n        The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\n        copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n        \n        THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n        IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n        FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Here is an example:\n        \n        ```js\n        {\n          type: ['object', 'null'],\n          additionalProperties: {\n            type: 'string',\n            minLength: 5\n          },\n          allOf: [{\n            type: ['array', 'object'],\n            additionalProperties: {\n              type: 'string',\n              minLength: 10,\n              maxLength: 20\n            }\n          }]\n        }\n        ```\n        \n        This result in the schema :\n        ```js\n        {\n          type: 'object',\n          additionalProperties: {\n            type: 'string',\n            minLength: 10,\n            maxLength: 20\n          }\n        }\n        ```\n        \n        Notice that type now excludes null and array since those are not logically possible. Also minLength is raised to 10. The other properties have no conflict and are merged into the root schema with no resolving needed.\n        \n        For other keywords other methods are used, here are some simple examples:\n        \n        - minLength, minimum, minItems etc chooses the **highest** value of the conflicting values.\n        - maxLength, maximum, maxItems etc chooses the **lowest** value of the conflicting values.\n        - uniqueItems is true if **any** of the conflicting values are true\n        \n        As you can see above the strategy is to choose the **most** restrictive of the set of values that conflict. For some keywords that is done by intersection, for others like **required** it is done by a union of all the values, since that is the most restrictive.\n        \n        What you are left with is a schema completely free of allOf. Except for in a couple of values that are impossible to properly intersect/combine:\n        \n        ### not\n        \n        When multiple conflicting **not** values are found, we also use the approach that pattern use, but instead of allOf we use anyOf. When extraction of common rules from anyOf is in place this can be further simplified.\n        \n        ## Options\n        **ignoreAdditionalProperties** default **false**\n        \n        Allows you to combine schema properties even though some schemas have `additionalProperties: false` This is the most common issue people face when trying to expand schemas using allOf and a limitation of the json schema spec. Be aware though that the schema produced will allow more than the original schema. But this is useful if just want to combine schemas using allOf as if additionalProperties wasn't false during the merge process. The resulting schema will still get additionalProperties set to false.\n        \n        **deep** boolean, default *true*\n        If false, resolves only the top-level `allOf` keyword in the schema.\n        \n        If true, resolves all `allOf` keywords in the schema.\n        \n        \n        **resolvers** Object\n        Override any default resolver like this:\n        \n        ```js\n        mergeAllOf(schema, {\n          resolvers: {\n            title: function(values, path, mergeSchemas, options) {\n              // choose what title you want to be used based on the conflicting values\n              // resolvers MUST return a value other than undefined\n            }\n          }\n        })\n        ```\n        \n        The function is passed:\n        \n        - **values** an array of the conflicting values that need to be resolved\n        - **path** an array of strings containing the path to the position in the schema that caused the resolver to be called (useful if you use the same resolver for multiple keywords, or want to implement specific logic for custom paths)\n        - **mergeSchemas** a function you can call that merges an array of schemas\n        - **options** the options mergeAllOf was called with\n        \n        \n        ### Combined resolvers\n        Some keyword are dependant on other keywords, like properties, patternProperties, additionalProperties. To create a resolver for these the resolver requires this structure:\n        \n        ```js\n        mergeAllOf(schema, {\n          resolvers: {\n            properties:\n              keywords: ['properties', 'patternProperties', 'additionalProperties'],\n              resolver(values, parents, mergers, options) {\n        \n              }\n            }\n          }\n        })\n        ```\n        \n        This type of resolvers are expected to return an object containing the resolved values of all the associated keywords. The keys must be the name of the keywords. So the properties resolver need to return an object like this containing the resolved values for each keyword:\n        \n        ```js\n        {\n            properties: ...,\n            patternProperties: ...,\n            additionalProperties: ...,\n        }\n        ```\n        \n        Also the resolve function is not passed **mergeSchemas**, but an object **mergers** that contains mergers for each of the related keywords. So properties get passed an object like this:\n        \n        ```js\n        const mergers = {\n            properties: function mergeSchemas(schemas, childSchemaName){...},\n            patternProperties: function mergeSchemas(schemas, childSchemaName){...},\n            additionalProperties: function mergeSchemas(schemas){...},\n        }\n        ```\n        \n        Some of the mergers requires you to supply a string of the name or index of the subschema you are currently merging. This is to make sure the path passed to child resolvers are correct.\n        \n        ### Default resolver\n        You can set a default resolver that catches any unknown keyword. Let's say you want to use the same strategy as the ones for the meta keywords, to use the first value found. You can accomplish that like this:\n        \n        ```js\n        mergeJsonSchema({\n          ...\n        }, {\n          resolvers: {\n            defaultResolver: mergeJsonSchema.options.resolvers.title\n          }\n        })\n        ```\n        \n        \n        ## Resolvers\n        \n        Resolvers are called whenever multiple conflicting values are found on the same position in the schemas.\n        \n        You can override a resolver by supplying it in the options.\n        \n        ### Lossy vs lossless\n        \n        All built in reducers for validation keywords are lossless, meaning that they don't remove or add anything in terms of validation.\n        \n        For meta keywords like title, description, $id, $schema, default the strategy is to use the first possible value if there are conflicting ones. So the root schema is prioritized. This process possibly removes some meta information from your schema. So it's lossy. Override this by providing custom resolvers.\n        \n        \n        ## $ref\n        \n        If one of your schemas contain a $ref property you should resolve them using a ref resolver like [json-schema-ref-parser](https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/json-schema-ref-parser) to dereference your schema for you first. Resolving $refs is not the task of this library.\n        \n        \n        ## Other libraries\n        \n        There exists some libraries that claim to merge schemas combined with allOf, but they just merge schemas using a **very** basic logic. Basically just the same as lodash merge. So you risk ending up with a schema that allows more or less than the original schema would allow.\n        \n        \n        ## Restrictions\n        \n        We cannot merge schemas that are a logical impossibility, like:\n        \n        ```js\n        {\n          type: 'object',\n          allOf: [{\n            type: 'array'\n          }]\n        }\n        ```\n        \n        The library will then throw an error reporting the values that had no valid intersection. But then again, your original schema wouldn't validate anything either.\n        \n        \n        ## Roadmap\n        \n        - [x] Treat the interdependent validations like properties and additionalProperties as one resolver (and items additionalItems)\n        - [ ] Extract repeating validators from anyOf/oneOf and merge them with parent schema\n        - [ ] After extraction of validators from anyOf/oneOf, compare them and remove duplicates.\n        - [ ] If left with only one in anyOf/oneOf then merge it to the parent schema.\n        - [ ] Expose seperate tools for validation, extraction\n        - [ ] Consider adding even more logical validation (like minLength <= maxLength)\n        \n        ## Contributing\n        \n        Create tests for new functionality and follow the eslint rules.\n        \n        ## License\n        \n        MIT © [Martin Hansen](http://martinhansen.com)\n        \n        -----------\n        \n        The following npm package may be included in this product:\n        \n         - json5@2.2.3\n        \n        This package contains the following license and notice below:\n        \n        MIT License\n        \n        Copyright (c) 2012-2018 Aseem Kishore, and [others].\n        \n        Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n        of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n        in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n        to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n        copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n        furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n        \n        The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\n        copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n        \n        THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n        IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n        FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The _initialData_ prop makes the tree an uncontrolled component. Create, move, rename, and delete will be handled internally.\n        \n        ```jsx\n        function App() {\n          return <Tree initialData={data} />;\n        }\n        ```\n        \n        <img width=\"214\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3460638/198098015-d7dc6400-6391-4094-9f66-0f56a99433e9.png\">\n        \n        [Demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/the-simplest-tree-7tbedw)\n        \n        ### Customize the Appearance\n        \n        We provide our own dimensions and our own `Node` component.\n        \n        ```jsx\n        function App() {\n          return (\n            <Tree\n              initialData={data}\n              openByDefault={false}\n              width={600}\n              height={1000}\n              indent={24}\n              rowHeight={36}\n              overscanCount={1}\n              paddingTop={30}\n              paddingBottom={10}\n              padding={25 /* sets both */}\n            >\n              {Node}\n            </Tree>\n          );\n        }\n        \n        function Node({ node, style, dragHandle }) {\n          /* This node instance can do many things.

We must handle all the data modifications ourselves using the props below.\n        \n        ```jsx\n        function App() {\n          /* Handle the data modifications outside the tree component */\n          const onCreate = ({ parentId, index, type }) => {};\n          const onRename = ({ id, name }) => {};\n          const onMove = ({ dragIds, parentId, index }) => {};\n          const onDelete = ({ ids }) => {};\n        \n          return (\n            <Tree\n              data={data}\n              onCreate={onCreate}\n              onRename={onRename}\n              onMove={onMove}\n              onDelete={onDelete}\n            />\n          );\n        }\n        ```\n        \n        ### Tree Filtering\n        \n        Providing a non-empty _searchTerm_ will only show nodes that match. If a child matches, all its parents also match. Internal nodes are opened when filtering. You can provide your own _searchMatch_ function, or use the default.\n        \n        ```jsx\n        function App() {\n          const term = useSearchTermString()\n          <Tree\n            data={data}\n            searchTerm={term}\n            searchMatch={\n              (node, term) => node.data.name.toLowerCase().includes(term.toLowerCase())\n            }\n          />\n        }\n        ```\n        \n        ### Sync the Selection\n        \n        It's common to open something elsewhere in the app, but have the tree reflect the new selection.\n        \n        Passing an id to the _selection_ prop will select and scroll to that node whenever that id changes.\n        \n        ```jsx\n        function App() {\n          const chatId = useCurrentChatId();\n        \n          /* \n            Whenever the currentChatRoomId changes, \n            the tree will automatically select it and scroll to it. \n          */\n        \n          return <Tree initialData={data} selection={chatId} />;\n        }\n        ```\n        \n        ### Use the Tree Api Instance\n        \n        You can access the Tree Api in the parent component by giving a ref to the tree.\n        \n        ```jsx\n        function App() {\n          const treeRef = useRef();\n        \n          useEffect(() => {\n            const tree = treeRef.current;\n            tree.selectAll();\n            /* See the Tree API reference for all you can do with it. */\n          }, []);\n        \n          return <Tree initialData={data} ref={treeRef} />;\n        }\n        ```\n        \n        ### Data with Different Property Names\n        \n        The _idAccessor_ and _childrenAccessor_ props allow you to specify the children and id fields in your data.\n        \n        ```jsx\n        function App() {\n          const data = [\n            {\n              category: \"Food\",\n              subCategories: [{ category: \"Restaurants\" }, { category: \"Groceries\" }],\n            },\n          ];\n          return (\n            <Tree\n              data={data}\n              /* An accessor can provide a string property name */\n              idAccessor=\"category\"\n              /* or a function with the data as the argument */\n              childrenAccessor={(d) => d.subCategories}\n            />\n          );\n        }\n        ```\n        \n        ### Custom Rendering\n        \n        Render every single piece of the tree yourself. See the API reference for the props passed to each renderer.\n        \n        ```jsx\n        function App() {\n          return (\n            <Tree\n              data={data}\n              /* The outer most element in the list */\n              renderRow={MyRow}\n              /* The \"ghost\" element that follows the mouse as you drag */\n              renderDragPreview={MyDragPreview}\n              /* The line that shows where an element will be dropped */\n              renderCursor={MyCursor}\n            >\n              {/* The inner element that shows the indentation and data */}\n              {MyNode}\n            </Tree>\n          );\n        }\n        ```\n        \n        ## API Reference\n        \n        - Components\n          - [Tree Component Props](#tree-component-props)\n          - [Row Component Props](#row-component-props)\n          - [Node Component Props](#node-component-props)\n          - [DragPreview Component Props](#dragpreview-component-props)\n          - [Cursor Component Props](#cursor-component-props)\n        - Interfaces\n          - [Node API](#node-api-reference)\n          - [Tree API](#tree-api-reference)\n        \n        ## Tree Component Props\n        \n        These are all the props you can pass to the Tree component.\n        \n        ```ts\n        interface TreeProps<T> {\n          /* Data Options */\n          data?: readonly T[];\n          initialData?: readonly T[];\n        \n          /* Data Handlers */\n          onCreate?: handlers.CreateHandler<T>;\n          onMove?: handlers.MoveHandler<T>;\n          onRename?: handlers.RenameHandler<T>;\n          onDelete?: handlers.DeleteHandler<T>;\n        \n          /* Renderers*/\n          children?: ElementType<renderers.NodeRendererProps<T>>;\n          renderRow?: ElementType<renderers.RowRendererProps<T>>;\n          renderDragPreview?: ElementType<renderers.DragPreviewProps>;\n          renderCursor?: ElementType<renderers.CursorProps>;\n          renderContainer?: ElementType<{}>;\n        \n          /* Sizes */\n          rowHeight?: number;\n          overscanCount?: number;\n          width?: number | string;\n          height?: number;\n          indent?: number;\n          paddingTop?: number;\n          paddingBottom?: number;\n          padding?: number;\n        \n          /* Config */\n          childrenAccessor?: string | ((d: T) => T[] | null);\n          idAccessor?: string | ((d: T) => string);\n          openByDefault?: boolean;\n          selectionFollowsFocus?: boolean;\n          disableMultiSelection?: boolean;\n          disableEdit?: string | boolean | BoolFunc<T>;\n          disableDrag?: string | boolean | BoolFunc<T>;\n          disableDrop?:\n            | string\n            | boolean\n            | ((args: {\n                parentNode: NodeApi<T>;\n                dragNodes: NodeApi<T>[];\n                index: number;\n              }) => boolean);\n        \n          /* Event Handlers */\n          onActivate?: (node: NodeApi<T>) => void;\n          onSelect?: (nodes: NodeApi<T>[]) => void;\n          onScroll?: (props: ListOnScrollProps) => void;\n          onToggle?: (id: string) => void;\n          onFocus?: (node: NodeApi<T>) => void;\n        \n          /* Selection */\n          selection?: string;\n        \n          /* Open State */\n          initialOpenState?: OpenMap;\n        \n          /* Search */\n          searchTerm?: string;\n          searchMatch?: (node: NodeApi<T>, searchTerm: string) => boolean;\n        \n          /* Extra */\n          className?: string | undefined;\n          rowClassName?: string | undefined;\n        \n          dndRootElement?: globalThis.Node | null;\n          onClick?: MouseEventHandler;\n          onContextMenu?: MouseEventHandler;\n          dndManager?: DragDropManager;\n        }\n        ```\n        \n        ## Row Component Props\n        \n        The _\\<RowRenderer\\>_ is responsible for attaching the drop ref, the row style (top, height) and the aria-attributes. The default should work fine for most use cases, but it can be replaced by your own component if you need. See the _renderRow_ prop in the _\\<Tree\\>_ component.\n        \n        ```ts\n        type RowRendererProps<T> = {\n          node: NodeApi<T>;\n          innerRef: (el: HTMLDivElement | null) => void;\n          attrs: HTMLAttributes<any>;\n          children: ReactElement;\n        };\n        ```\n        \n        ## Node Component Props\n        \n        The _\\<NodeRenderer\\>_ is responsible for attaching the drag ref, the node style (padding for indentation), the visual look of the node, the edit input of the node, and anything else you can dream up.\n        \n        There is a default renderer, but it's only there as a placeholder to get started. You'll want to create your own component for this. It is passed as the _\\<Tree\\>_ components only child.\n        \n        ```ts\n        export type NodeRendererProps<T> = {\n          style: CSSProperties;\n          node: NodeApi<T>;\n          tree: TreeApi<T>;\n          dragHandle?: (el: HTMLDivElement | null) => void;\n          preview?: boolean;\n        };\n        ```\n        \n        ## DragPreview Component Props\n        \n        The _\\<DragPreview\\>_ is responsible for showing a \"ghost\" version of the node being dragged. The default is a semi-transparent version of the NodeRenderer and should work fine for most people. To customize it, pass your new component to the _renderDragPreview_ prop.\n        \n        ```ts\n        type DragPreviewProps = {\n          offset: XYCoord | null;\n          mouse: XYCoord | null;\n          id: string | null;\n          dragIds: string[];\n          isDragging: boolean;\n        };\n        ```\n        \n        ## Cursor Component Props\n        \n        The _\\<Cursor\\>_ is responsible for showing a line that indicates where the node will move to when it's dropped. The default is a blue line with circle on the left side. You may want to customize this. Pass your own component to the _renderCursor_ prop.\n        \n        ```ts\n        export type CursorProps = {\n          top: number;\n          left: number;\n          indent: number;\n        };\n        ```\n        \n        ## Node API Reference\n        \n        ### State Properties\n        \n        All these properties on the node instance return booleans related to the state of the node.\n        \n        _node_.**isRoot**\n        \n        Returns true if this is the root node.

If you would like to extend `PackageJson` to support an additional configuration in your project, please see the *Extending existing types* section below.\n        \n        ## Alternative type names\n        \n        *If you know one of our types by a different name, add it here for discovery.*\n        \n        - `PartialBy` - See [`SetOptional`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/blob/main/source/set-optional.d.ts)\n        - `RecordDeep`- See [`Schema`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/type-fest/blob/main/source/schema.d.ts)\n        \n        ## Tips\n        \n        ### Extending existing types\n        \n        - [`PackageJson`](source/package-json.d.ts) - There are a lot of tools that place extra configurations inside the `package.json` file.
